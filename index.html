    <li>
      <strong>Chess</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The project aims at developing a chess game for two players in python. It is built using the python library ‘pygame’. All the standard rules of chess like check, en passant, checkmate, stalemate, etc., are implemented. Furthermore, additional features like ‘undoMove’, ‘reset’, ‘highlightMove’ and other animation features have also been added for undoing a move, resetting the game to the start position, and highlighting and animating each move made by the players. At the end of the game, a message pops up showing either black or white wins by checkmate or stalemate if the game ends in a stalemate.</li>
